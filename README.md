# team-roster

This application lets a user create a webpage that neatly displays a project team. The user is prompted through command line prompts (powered by inquirer) to input an employee's information, which is then passed to different class constructors based on the person's position on the team. This info is then passed through html templates and joined together to put all of the information on one html page, which is created automatically when the user is done entering employees. 

To use this app, open the app.js file within your terminal and run it with node. Then simply follow the prompts!
